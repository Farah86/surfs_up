# SURFS AND ICECREAM:
# 1.Overview of the statistical analysis:
MR.W. Avy is an investor who is planning to open a project in Oahu for surfing and icecream he needed our help to analyez his data for the last few years to insure that the place is gonna be a great fit for his planes ,this analyez include all the best stations and tempreture in there to make sure it wont bother the people who visit in rain season for example,we gonna use few tools to help us reach the goal,SQLAlchemy,jupyter notebook,flask .

# 2.Results:
after searching and analysing the data we got the results that the main three difrences between June and December is:
a.by comparing both months we find that JUne for sure have the highest digree which mean more surfing and icecream

# 3.Summary:
after doing all the search for Mr.Avy we can tell that those both months and in between can start with high tempreture and high humidity which is so perfect for surf and eat icecream going down to the cold weather which can be a little bit more risky to surf in this time you see more of the pro people who can surf in this weather we can provide the company with more clear view of those information because am sure non of them have a detailed idea about codeing we can use plot to show the tourist rating between those two months and maybe do two more to show us how the tempreture can go high and low in each of June and December using both of those codes:
